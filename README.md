# Dotfiles

I'm using Fedora Linux. In this repository I manage my system's dotfiles.

## Branches

During global system changes (reinstalling OS) I keep an old versions of my dotfiles in a separate branch. Because usualy I don't keep all apps and utilities, so I remove some of dotfiles in main branch.

- **main** - my current config.
- **fedora38** - my config on 2023-11-17.
