# Dotfiles

I'm using Fedora Linux. In this repository I manage my system's dotfiles.

## Branches

I manage my dotfiles with **nix home-manager**. Different systems have different `home.nix` modules. So I don't need different branches for my current configuration. Only branch is my legacy configuration. I keep it because I don't have dotfiles for some programs in the `main` branch.

- **main** - my current config with home-manager.
- **fedora38** - my config on 2023-11-17.
