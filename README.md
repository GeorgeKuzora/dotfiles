# Dotfiles

This repository is where I manage my system's dotfiles.

## Branches

I manage my dotfiles using the **[chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/)** CLI tool alongside the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager. Chezmoi leverages [Go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) to handle dotfiles across different systems, eliminating the need for separate branches for each configuration.
